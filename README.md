# Decentralized Marketplace Based on Ethereum Blockchain

## Overview

**Blockchain Marketplace** - Empowering Decentralized Trade with Ethereum Cryptocurrency.

With live transaction ledger details.

In 2023, over 3.1 billion people purchased goods online, leading to an expenditure of $4.8 trillion. Traditional companies like Amazon, eBay, and PayPal act as intermediaries between sellers and buyers, charging fees that can accumulate significantly. Our project leverages **Blockchain Technology** to decentralize the online marketplace, removing the need for middlemen and the associated fees.

To achieve this, we utilize **smart contracts** on the **Ethereum Blockchain** while maintaining a decentralized architecture using **Vite-React** for web hosting. Furthermore, this technology can be employed to create a shared inventory or ledger across various marketplaces, allowing manufacturers or sellers to announce their products freely among multiple existing websites concurrently using the **Goerli faucet Ethereum testnet**.

## Project Motivation

The current online shopping landscape is dominated by large platforms that not only act as intermediaries but also dictate terms to both buyers and sellers. These platforms charge high fees, which can affect the prices consumers pay and the profits sellers receive. Our project aims to disrupt this model by creating a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers can interact directly, ensuring transparency, lower costs, and enhanced trust.

### Key Benefits of a Decentralized Marketplace

1. **Lower Transaction Costs**: By eliminating the middleman, transaction fees can be reduced significantly, allowing both buyers and sellers to benefit financially.
2. **Enhanced Security**: Blockchain technology ensures that all transactions are secure, transparent, and immutable. This helps in building trust between users.
3. **Global Accessibility**: Our platform is designed to be accessible from anywhere in the world, allowing users to buy and sell goods without geographical constraints.
4. **Empowerment of Sellers**: Sellers can reach customers directly without relying on third-party platforms, allowing for better pricing control and marketing strategies.

## How It Works

### Key Components

- **Smart Contracts**: The backbone of our marketplace is the use of smart contracts. These self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code automate transactions and ensure that they are executed only when certain conditions are met. This minimizes the risk of fraud and increases operational efficiency.
  
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: Utilizing the Ethereum blockchain provides a decentralized, transparent, and secure environment for transactions. The Goerli testnet allows us to simulate real-world interactions without using actual Ether, making it a perfect environment for development and testing.

- **Web Interface**: The marketplace is built using React Vite and Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface. Users can easily navigate the platform, manage their accounts, and track transactions in real-time.

### Transaction Process

1. **User Registration**: Users create an account using a secure process that integrates with Metamask for Ethereum wallet management.
2. **Listing Products**: Sellers can list their products directly on the platform. Smart contracts handle the details of each listing.
3. **Making Transactions**: Buyers can browse products and make purchases using Ethereum. The transaction details are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
4. **Live Transaction History**: Users can view their transaction history in real-time, complete with transaction IDs and statuses.
